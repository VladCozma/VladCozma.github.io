 orchestration = arranging network communication and credentials exchange.  
 
 master = control plane. we should use multi-master high availability. How many? 3-5. 1 is better than 2, as if the 2nd fails, there's no consensus and the cluster goes read-only.  

 hosted k8s -> the platform runs k8s as a service, so hidden number of masters, control plance, versions, etc... GKE, AKS, AWS EKS.  
 
 node:  
  kubelet -> k8s agent (Linux, windows)  
  container runtime -> mostly Docker, but containerd, CRI-O, Kata can happend (katacontainers)  
  kube-proxy -> network   
  
  nodeless kubernetes? -> container platform   
  
  Declarative model: describe the desired state in a manifest file  
  
  
  pod - shared execution environment (same ip, resources, etc) -> the pod is the vm  
  
  
  kubernetes API -> the set of all k8s objects (deployments, nodes, pods, ...)  
  
  schema:
  {% include aligner.html images="k8s-basic/k8s-basic.png" %}
